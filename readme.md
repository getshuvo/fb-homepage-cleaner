#Whats this?
This is a **Greasemoneky** Scirpt or User Script. It's functionality is to remove user shared images and hide *people you may know* section from facebook homepage.

My facebook homepage was cluttered by my friends shared images. So I wrote this script to remove those images on the fly.
